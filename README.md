### Creating a Potion
To create a potion, create a prefab similar to the ones [here](https://github.com/Terasology/Potions/tree/master/assets/prefabs/potion) at `Potions/assets/prefabs/potion/` and add the associated icon to `Potions/assets/textures/potions/`.
For instance, to create a potion called "HealthBoost", the prefab should look like
```
{
    "parent": "engine:iconItem",
    "Item": {
        "icon": "Potions:HealthBoostPotion1Bottle",
        "stackId": "Potions:healthBoostPotion",
        "consumedOnUse": true
    },
    "DisplayName": {
        "name": "Potion of Minor Health Boost",
        "description": "Increases the user's base max health by 50% for 30 seconds."
    },
    "Potion": {
        "hasGenome": false,
        "effects": [
            {
                "effect": "TEMP_MAX_HEALTH_BOOST",
                "magnitude": 50,
                "duration": 30010
            }
        ]
    },
    "ItemHelp": {
        "category": "Potions",
        "paragraphText": [
             "Increases the user's base max health by 50% for 30 seconds."
        ]
    }
}
```
where "HealthBoostPotion1Bottle.png" is the name of the icon file which resides in `Potions/assets/textures/potions/`,  
`DisplayName` and `ItemHelp` carry information relevant to the potion,  
the `effects` field inside Potion contains a list of effects the potion carries.  
All pre-defined potions in this module should have a hasGenome of false because they were not generated by the Herbalism system.  
All potions should have a consumedOnUse set as true so that they exhaust after usage.  
Each effect has an associated `magnitude` and `duration`.  
**Multiple effects** can be used too in this fashion:

```
 "Potion": {
        "hasGenome": false,
        "effects": [
            {
                "effect": "WALK",
                "magnitude": 2,
                "duration": 10100
            },
            {
                "effect": "SWIM",
                "magnitude": 2,
                "duration": 10100
            },
            {
                "effect": "JUMP",
                "magnitude": 2,
                "duration": 10100
            }
        ]
}
```

### Creating a container

Presently we have bottles and vials as containers. To create a similar container, create a prefab similar to [these](https://github.com/Terasology/Potions/tree/master/assets/prefabs) at `Potions/assets/prefabs/`. Also add or use an existing icon from `Potions/assets/textures/`.

For instance, to create a "GlassBottle", the prefab should look like:
```
{
    "parent": "engine:iconItem",
    "Item": {
        "icon": "Potions:EmptyPotionBottle",
        "stackId": "Potions:glassBottle",
        "consumedOnUse": false
    },
    "DisplayName": {
        "name": "Glass Bottle",
        "description": "Used for storing fluids such as potions or water."
    },
    "EmptyPotion": {
    },
    "Durability": {
        "durability": 3,
        "maxDurability": 3
    },
    "FluidContainerItem": {
        "volume": 0.4,
        "maxVolume": 0.4,
        "fluidMinPerc": [0.1875, 0.15625],
        "fluidSizePerc": [0.625, 0.4375],
        "textureWithHole": "Potions:EmptyPotionBottle",
        "emptyTexture": "Potions:EmptyPotionBottle"
    },
    "ItemHelp": {
        "category": "Alchemy",
        "paragraphText": [
            "Used for storing fluids such as potions or water."
        ]
    }
}
```
where "EmptyPotionBottle.png" is the name of the icon file which resides in `Potions/assets/textures/`,  
`DisplayName` and `ItemHelp` carry information relevant to the container,  
`durability` measures the current durability level of the bottle. If durability is <= 0, the item gets destroyed.  
`maxDurability` is the maximum durability allowed with this object.
`FluidContainerItem` specify other related parameters.  
`textureWithHole` specifies the icon when the bottle has fluid in it  
`fluidMinPerc` and `fluidSizePerc` determine how the fluid is drawn in the container  
`volume` measures the current amount of the current fluid that's inside of this fluid container in litres
`maxVolume` is the max amount of fluid that can be stored in this container in litres.

The blank `EmptyPotion` field specifies this prefab as a potion container.
